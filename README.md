# LipSync
Created an AI model that is proficient in lip-syncing i.e. synchronizing an audio file with a video file using Wav2Lip.

This repository contains an AI model that utilizes Wav2Lip for lip-syncing, which is the process of synchronizing an audio file with a video file. Wav2Lip is a deep learning-based approach that generates realistic lip movements from input audio. This model can be used for various applications, such as dubbing, video editing, or creating lip-sync animations.

#How It Works
The lip-sync AI model is built using the following components and steps:

Wav2Lip: Wav2Lip is a lip-sync model that takes an input audio waveform and a video file containing the target speaker's face as input. It generates lip movements that are synchronized with the provided audio.

Preprocessing: The input video file is preprocessed to extract the frames containing the target speaker's face. These frames are used as the visual input for Wav2Lip.

Audio Processing: The input audio file is processed to extract the audio waveform, which serves as the audio input for Wav2Lip.

Lip-Sync Generation: Wav2Lip takes the extracted audio waveform and the corresponding video frames as input and generates lip movements that match the provided audio.

Output Video: The lip-synced video is created by combining the original video frames with the generated lip movements. The resulting video file has synchronized audio and lip movements.

#Getting Started
To use the lip-sync AI model, follow these steps:

Requirements: Make sure you have the necessary dependencies installed. This may include Python, TensorFlow, OpenCV, and other libraries. You can find the specific requirements in the requirements.txt file.

Data Preparation: Prepare the input video file and audio file that you want to synchronize. The video file should contain the target speaker's face, and the audio file should correspond to the lip movements you want to generate.

Preprocessing: Use a video processing tool or library to extract the frames containing the target speaker's face from the video file. Save these frames in a directory.

Audio Processing: If necessary, preprocess the audio file to ensure it is in a suitable format for Wav2Lip. This may involve converting the audio to a specific sample rate or format.

Run the Model: Run the lip-sync AI model by providing the preprocessed video frames and audio file as input to Wav2Lip. The model will generate lip movements synchronized with the provided audio.

Output Video: Combine the generated lip movements with the original video frames to create the final lip-synced video. You can use a video editing tool or library for this step.

#Example Usage
python inference.py --video video_frames/ --audio audio.wav --output lip_synced_video.mp4

In this example, video_frames/ is the directory containing the preprocessed video frames, audio.wav is the audio file, and lip_synced_video.mp4 is the desired output file name for the lip-synced video.
